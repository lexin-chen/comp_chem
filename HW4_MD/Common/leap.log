/apps/cuda/11.0.207/gcc/9.3.0/amber/20/bin/teLeap: Fatal Error!
addIons: Argument #1 is type String must be of type: [unit]

    addIons unit ion1 #ion1 [ion2 #ion2]
      UNIT                      _unit_
      UNIT                      _ion1_
      NUMBER                    _#ion1_
      UNIT                      _ion2_
      NUMBER                    _#ion2_
Adds counterions in a shell around _unit_ using a Coulombic potential
on a grid. If _#ion1_ is 0, the _unit_ is neutralized (_ion1_ must be
opposite in charge to _unit_, and _ion2_ cannot be specified). Otherwise,
the specified numbers of _ion1_ [_ion2_] are added [in alternating order].
If solvent is present, it is ignored in the charge and steric calculations,
and if an ion has a steric conflict with a solvent molecule, the ion is
moved to the center of said molecule, and the latter is deleted. (To
avoid this behavior, either solvate _after_ addIons, or use addIons2.)
Ions must be monoatomic. Note that the one-at-a-time procedure is not
guaranteed to globally minimize the electrostatic energy. When neutralizing
regular-backbone nucleic acids, the first cations will generally be added
between phosphates, leaving the final two ions to be placed somewhere around
the middle of the molecule.
The default grid resolution is 1 Angstrom, extending from an inner radius
of (max ion size + max solute atom size) to an outer radius 4 Angstroms
beyond. A distance-dependent dielectric is used for speed.

addIons: Argument #1 is type String must be of type: [unit]

    addIons unit ion1 #ion1 [ion2 #ion2]
      UNIT                      _unit_
      UNIT                      _ion1_
      NUMBER                    _#ion1_
      UNIT                      _ion2_
      NUMBER                    _#ion2_
Adds counterions in a shell around _unit_ using a Coulombic potential
on a grid. If _#ion1_ is 0, the _unit_ is neutralized (_ion1_ must be
opposite in charge to _unit_, and _ion2_ cannot be specified). Otherwise,
the specified numbers of _ion1_ [_ion2_] are added [in alternating order].
If solvent is present, it is ignored in the charge and steric calculations,
and if an ion has a steric conflict with a solvent molecule, the ion is
moved to the center of said molecule, and the latter is deleted. (To
avoid this behavior, either solvate _after_ addIons, or use addIons2.)
Ions must be monoatomic. Note that the one-at-a-time procedure is not
guaranteed to globally minimize the electrostatic energy. When neutralizing
regular-backbone nucleic acids, the first cations will generally be added
between phosphates, leaving the final two ions to be placed somewhere around
the middle of the molecule.
The default grid resolution is 1 Angstrom, extending from an inner radius
of (max ion size + max solute atom size) to an outer radius 4 Angstroms
beyond. A distance-dependent dielectric is used for speed.

/apps/cuda/11.0.207/gcc/9.3.0/amber/20/bin/teLeap: Fatal Error!
addIons: Argument #1 is type String must be of type: [unit]

    addIons unit ion1 #ion1 [ion2 #ion2]
      UNIT                      _unit_
      UNIT                      _ion1_
      NUMBER                    _#ion1_
      UNIT                      _ion2_
      NUMBER                    _#ion2_
Adds counterions in a shell around _unit_ using a Coulombic potential
on a grid. If _#ion1_ is 0, the _unit_ is neutralized (_ion1_ must be
opposite in charge to _unit_, and _ion2_ cannot be specified). Otherwise,
the specified numbers of _ion1_ [_ion2_] are added [in alternating order].
If solvent is present, it is ignored in the charge and steric calculations,
and if an ion has a steric conflict with a solvent molecule, the ion is
moved to the center of said molecule, and the latter is deleted. (To
avoid this behavior, either solvate _after_ addIons, or use addIons2.)
Ions must be monoatomic. Note that the one-at-a-time procedure is not
guaranteed to globally minimize the electrostatic energy. When neutralizing
regular-backbone nucleic acids, the first cations will generally be added
between phosphates, leaving the final two ions to be placed somewhere around
the middle of the molecule.
The default grid resolution is 1 Angstrom, extending from an inner radius
of (max ion size + max solute atom size) to an outer radius 4 Angstroms
beyond. A distance-dependent dielectric is used for speed.
